Now that we have build our first React & PouchDB App it might be a good time to read
[PouchDB guides](https://pouchdb.com/guides/) and
[CouchDB guides](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/index.html) (if you didn't).

## Too long; didn't cover

There are some things we didn't handle in this tutorial:

- How to [delete documents](https://pouchdb.com/guides/updating-deleting.html#deleting-documents).
- Handling [eventual conflicts](https://pouchdb.com/guides/conflicts.html).
- [Mango queries](https://pouchdb.com/guides/mango-queries.html) (also read
  [CouchDB's docs with all operators](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html)).
- [Map/reduce queries](https://pouchdb.com/guides/queries.html).
- [Attachments](https://pouchdb.com/guides/attachments.html) (files on your documents).
- [Local documents](https://pouchdb.com/guides/local-documents.html) (documents that don't sync).
